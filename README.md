## About

In this repository, I delve into the fascinating field of deep learning, which involves training neural networks to learn complex patterns and make predictions or decisions. Deep learning has applications in areas such as computer vision, natural language processing, and reinforcement learning. Through this collection of projects, I aim to gain hands-on experience and expand my knowledge in the field.

## Projects

This directory contains a variety of deep-learning projects that I have worked on. Each project is organized in its own directory and includes code, datasets (if applicable), and a `README.md` file with project details, objectives, and instructions on running the code. Feel free to explore these projects to see different applications of deep learning techniques.

## Resources

In addition to the projects, this repository also includes a curated list of resources that I have found helpful in my deep learning journey. These resources include tutorials, books, research papers, online courses, and useful libraries or frameworks. Check out the `Resources` directory to find valuable references and learning materials.
